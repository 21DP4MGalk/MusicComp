## What is this?

MusicComp is a website for simple compositions and experimentation with Bezier-curve based synthesis of sound. The goals of this project are as follows:
- Basic classical notation

- Custom instruments based on wavetables
- Custom instruments based on Bezier curves of the waveform

Made for the qualification work of RVT 4th course.
