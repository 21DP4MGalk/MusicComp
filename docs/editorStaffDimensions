Fundamental measurement: canX/100 and canY/100 - 1% of width or height of the canvas

Beginning of first staff = canY/10;
Staff sides: canX/10 - canX/10 * 9;

spacing between staves - i*14 * canY/100
height of staff = canY/10

x = x_pos/ (canX/100);
Math.round(X)
x = x * canX/100

y = y_pos / (canY/200);
Math.round(y);
y = y * canY/200;


first available x note position: 15%



rests on yIndex 4 and 16
