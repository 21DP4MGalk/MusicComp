		<h2> SATISFIED CUSTOMER TESTIMONIALS </h2>
		<p> You're reading that right, despite our website <br>
		having an uptime of approximately 0 minutes on public servers, <br>
		we've decided to indulge in insider trading (legally a joke) <br>
		and we're more than happy to show off what our satisfied clients <br>
		have reported so far!. <br>

			"Honestly this is the best thing to have happenned to me, <br>
			I've grown about 3 feet taller, my muscles have grown so <br>
			much that I am confident I could finally hit my gym goals, <br>
			attract all the ladies, scare off the jehovah's witnesses <br>
			and get a 10 in the exam. Your results may vary though, don't <br>
			sue me." - <i>Project founder and only developer</i>
